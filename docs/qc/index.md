# Quality Control (QC)

## Overview

**Quality Control (QC)** serves as the foundational interface between human-AI collaboration and real-world engineering acceptance. Rather than creating yet another benchmark, QC integrates and orchestrates existing evaluation methods into a unified four-dimensional framework.

## Philosophy: Integration Over Innovation

QC recognizes that over 291 coding benchmarks already exist, each focusing on different aspects of correctness, efficiency, or realism. Our approach:

- **Leverages existing excellence** instead of reinventing evaluation
- **Orchestrates proven benchmarks** under a unified quality contract
- **Provides immediate deployment** using existing tools and infrastructure
- **Builds on community consensus** with established validity

## Four-Dimensional Framework

QC evaluates AI-generated code across four uncompromising dimensions, each weighted equally (25%):

### 1. Correctness (25%)
*Does it work?*
- **HumanEval+**: Extended test cases for function-level correctness
- **LiveCodeBench**: Competitive programming for program-level solutions
- **SWE-bench**: GitHub issue resolution for repository-level correctness

### 2. Efficiency (25%)
*Is it fast?*
- **Mercury & EffiBench**: Performance evaluation beyond pass/fail
- **Runtime profiling**: Execution time vs. canonical solutions
- **Memory analysis**: Resource usage optimization

### 3. Security (25%)
*Is it safe?*
- **SecurityEval**: Vulnerability pattern detection
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for exploitable patterns
- **Bandit/ESLint**: Language-specific security linters

### 4. Conformance (25%)
*Is it maintainable?*
- **PEP 8/ESLint**: Style guide compliance
- **Documentation coverage**: Docstring and comment analysis
- **API usage patterns**: Library contract adherence

## Scoring System

QC uses a **weighted harmonic mean** that implements the "shortest-plank principle" - poor performance in any dimension significantly impacts overall quality:

```
QC = (Σ(w_j / (s_j + ε)))^(-1)
```

Where:
- `s_j`: normalized score per dimension (0.0-1.0)
- `w_j`: dimension weights (default: 0.25 each)
- `ε`: stability constant

### Quality Gates
- **Pass (≥0.8)**: Industrial-ready code
- **Conditional Pass (0.6-0.8)**: Needs improvements
- **Fail (<0.6)**: Requires significant work

## Key Advantages

Rather than creating new benchmarks, QC addresses **industry applicability** through integration:

- **Methodological Soundness**: Avoids duplication and leverages community consensus
- **Practical Implementation**: Can be deployed today using existing infrastructure
- **Academic Positioning**: Creates a meta-benchmark framework that synthesizes rather than competes
- **Industrial Realism**: Four-dimensional evaluation mirrors real engineering standards

## Examples & Implementation

### Live Demonstration
The **[Binary Calculator Sample](../../examples/qc/)** provides a complete working example that demonstrates QC evaluation of AI-generated code across all four dimensions.

**Sample Results:**
| Version | Correctness | Efficiency | Security | Conformance | Overall | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Original | 1.000 | 0.993 | 0.800 | 0.667 | **0.841** | ✅ PASS |
| Flawed | 0.000 | 0.500 | 0.400 | 0.626 | **0.000** | ❌ FAIL |

### Integration Approach
```python
# Correctness: Integrate existing benchmarks
correctness_score = evaluate_with_existing_benchmarks([
    'HumanEval+',     # Function-level correctness
    'LiveCodeBench',  # Program-level solutions
    'SWE-bench',      # Repository-level issues
])

# Security: Apply established tools
security_score = run_security_analysis([
    'SecurityEval',   # Vulnerability patterns
    'CodeQL',         # Static analysis
    'Bandit',         # Python security linter
])
```
