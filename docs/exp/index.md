## Current Status

This section is under construction.  
We will expand it to include:

- A survey of existing explainability measures in code generation  
- Links to epistemology and pedagogy in software engineering  
- Early proposals for rubric-based evaluation and learning outcome studies

ðŸš§ **Coming soon:** Detailed framework, metrics, and protocols.
