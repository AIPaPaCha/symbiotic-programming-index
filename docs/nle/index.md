# Natural Language Engagement (NLE)

## Overview

Natural Language Engagement (NLE) asks:

ðŸ‘‰ *Does symbiotic programming remain effective across languages and cultures, or does it privilege English-only workflows?*

## Current Status

This section is under construction.  
We will expand it to include:

- Studies of cross-lingual drift in LLM programming  
- Implications for education and global equity  
- Experimental protocols for multi-language orchestration tasks

ðŸš§ **Coming soon:** Comprehensive NLE framework and benchmarks.
