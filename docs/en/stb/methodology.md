# Methodology

**Framing**: Turn philosophy (authorship, agency, accountability) into **operational metrics**.

**Hypotheses** (abridged):
1) Productivity requires **Stb** without sacrificing **Qc**  
2) Human role shifts to orchestration (↑HoR) if **Qc/Stb** hold and **Exp** is intelligible  
3) Hybrid QA (AI checks + human oversight) outperforms extremes  
4) Languages evolve into orchestration DSLs when **Exp/Stb** are strong

**Protocols**:
- Controlled tasks across 3 modes: human-only, AI-only, orchestrated  
- Logging: prompts, outputs, diffs, tests, interventions  
- Validity: convergent metrics (defects, time), test–retest reliability, cross-model generalization
